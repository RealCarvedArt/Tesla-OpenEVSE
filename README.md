## BUILD NOTES:
- Made a custom aluminum backplate to fit into the Tesla Gen 2 housing
- Reused the original Tesla Gen 2 relay mounting backplate/heatshield to mount the OpenEVSE relay
- Reused mounting screws and standoffs from the Tesla Gen 2 to mount the OpenEVSE Charging Station Controller
- Mounted the OpenEVSE WiFi Controller under the cable end socket so the status LEDs eluminate the original sight window on the Tesla Gen 2 housing cover
- Opted not to cut the Tesla Gen 2 housing or cover to mount the OpenEVSE LCD Screen to retain the watertight seal
- The original Tesla Gen 2 Reset Button could be utilized to actuate the optional button (Button Menu) on the OpenEVSE LCD Screen by adding a Jst 2.0 Ph 3 Pin pigtail
- Was able to retain all of the Tesla Gen 2 factory terminations on the cable by carefully bending the fork-type terminal ends to just push through the OpenEVSE AMP & GFCI Coils (Much patients & calculated alignment of each cable & terminal is required)</br>
